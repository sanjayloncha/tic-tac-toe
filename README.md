# tic-tac-toe

Simple tic-tac-toe game you can play .

Build with pure Vanilla JS.

Feature i tried to impliment are :
1. Whoever wins the game , "X" or "O" then after that no one will be able to play further untill clicked on reset button.
2. If no one wins and all box are filled with "X" and "O" then it will show Draw message.
3. In the middle of the game ,if you want to restart then you can simply click on reset button and it will start the freah game!
3. When 3 "X" or "O" are in a row or coloum or diagonally present , this means the one "X" or "O" won the game, so it will stop the game to let you play further as game is over. And whichever the three are in row or coloum or diagonally  present then one line with animation will appear to let you know who wins.
